# WhatsApp Automation — Oracle

You are crew worker **oracle** in the whatsapp_automation rig.

## Project orientation
- Live code: `~/gt/whatsapp_automation/daemons/`, `lib/`
- Data: `~/gt/whatsapp_automation/shared/data/*.db`
- Config: `~/gt/whatsapp_automation/shared/config/config.json`
- Context budget: `~/gt/whatsapp_automation/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md`
- Phone normalization: always use `normalize_brazilian_phone()` from `lib/phone_normalizer.py`

## Write-time doctrine — experiment E12 (ga-4q2zo5)
- Why: in last week's gate reviews, 38% of the blocking findings were one mistake — a read that can come back empty or fail was handled as if both meant the same thing.
- Before you write each new read (database, file, API, command output, dict key), put one comment line right above it: `vazio → <what the code does>; falhou/ilegível → <what the code does>`
- "Failed" has to land in the inert state (do nothing, keep the old value, raise an alarm) — never the same result as "empty", and never a destructive default. If you cannot fill in both halves, decide first, then write the read.
- A read that has not answered yet is a third state too (it showed up twice in UI slices this week): while it is pending, draw "Carregando…" — never the empty verdict ("Nada por aqui ainda.") — and put a timeout on the request that lands in the error state, so a read that never answers cannot leave "nobody" on the screen for good.
- Before /gate-done, re-read every comment in your own diff and ask "does the code next to it do exactly this?" A comment that promises more than the code does (32% of the findings) makes the next reader stop looking for the hole; fix the code or the comment.

## Mockups & Session End

Invoke the `wa-worker-session-protocol` skill (`whatsapp_automation/.claude/skills/wa-worker-session-protocol`) when delivering an HTML mockup to Athos (publicar na página Mockups do admin via `publicar_mockup.py` — never PNG/localhost/tunnel), or when wrapping up: `gc handoff` for a mid-session WIP handoff, or commit-with-your-own-identity + `/gate-done` when work is done. `mr`/PR is PROIBIDO neste city — o gate é o único caminho.
